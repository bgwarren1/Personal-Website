### U-Know-Uno: Probabilistic Game Solver

**Live Site:** [https://uknowuno.streamlit.app/](https://uknowuno.streamlit.app/)  
**Repository:** [github.com/bgwarren1/U-know-Uno](https://github.com/bgwarren1/U-know-Uno)

An interactive web application that calculates probabilistically optimal moves for the card game Uno using Monte Carlo simulation and game tree analysis.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time Optimization:** Analyzes game state and computes optimal play strategies in milliseconds
- **Probability Visualization:** Interactive charts showing win probabilities for each possible move
- **Custom Game Logic:** Implements full Uno rule set including special cards, stacking, and challenge mechanics
- **Responsive Interface:** Clean, intuitive UI built for both desktop and mobile gameplay

**Technical Implementation:**

- Developed custom probability engine using Monte Carlo methods to simulate thousands of game outcomes
- Implemented efficient game state representation and move generation algorithms
- Built frontend with modern JavaScript frameworks for smooth, responsive user experience
- Optimized performance to handle complex calculations without blocking UI

**Impact:** Created a tool that helps players understand strategic decision-making in Uno through quantitative analysis, making probability theory accessible and engaging.

### Big 10 Transition Analysis: Predictive Modeling in College Football

**Repository:** [github.com/bgwarren1/bsa-big10-predictive-analysis](https://github.com/bgwarren1/bsa-big10-predictive-analysis)

A comprehensive data science project analyzing the 2024 Big Ten conference expansion, predicting how UCLA, USC, Oregon, and Washington would perform after transitioning from the Pac-12.

**Research Questions:**

- How do environmental factors (weather, travel distance) impact team performance?
- Can we predict win probability based on historical patterns and new conference dynamics?
- What competitive advantages or disadvantages do West Coast teams face in the Big Ten?

**Methodology:**

- **Data Collection:** Aggregated multi-season data including game results, weather conditions, travel distances, and team statistics
- **Feature Engineering:** Created novel metrics combining geographic, climatic, and performance variables
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built and compared multiple models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to forecast game outcomes
- **Statistical Validation:** Conducted rigorous hypothesis testing and cross-validation to ensure model reliability

**Key Findings:**

- Quantified the impact of travel fatigue on away game performance for West Coast teams
- Identified weather adaptation as a significant factor in predicted win rates
- Developed conference-adjusted power rankings based on historical matchup data

**Technologies Used:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels), R (ggplot2, dplyr), Jupyter Notebooks, statistical hypothesis testing

**Outcome:** Produced actionable insights into competitive dynamics of conference realignment, demonstrating ability to apply data science to sports analytics and strategic forecasting.
